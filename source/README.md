# Building Your Challenge

## Quick and easy docker compose up.

The container binds port 2025 to the services exposed port 10001. This can be changed inside the docker-compose file.

## DO NOT BUILD FROM SOURCE CODE. 

### The pre-built binary is used in the docker container and is also given to the participant.
### This pre-built version includes known offsets for the solution, exploit.py, to work.

### I have only included the source code and build script for archival purposes
