# Building Your Challenge

## All that is needed is to build the docker container: 

```
docker build .
```

## DO NOT BUILD FROM SOURCE CODE. 

### The pre-built binary and libc are used in the docker container and are also given to the participant.

### I have only included the source code and build script for archival purposed
